DUMP:
===========================
* starting position apart from destination in itinerary
* DO NOT PUSH ADS LIKE CANDY !!!!!
* NO POP-UPS
* user-friendly and simple route, do not use abbreviations
* let the user pick if they want to add a hotel, do not push it down their throat
* preselections of things to choose (will help a lot to add what would be interesting to the trip)
* itinerary as a function of time (increments of 15 mins ???)
* save on local before asking to create account ???
* drag and drop itinerary POI would be really nice
* when suggesting something, give it as an option (ex: transport between location, recommend different ways, like walking, public transport, taxi, uber etc.)
* add prices for transport, entries etc, / separate page for budget
* BUDGET PAGE (last to implement, also tell if prices are missing)
* google+ reviews
* image carousel should be long enough to read the text
* trip critical info (visa, vaccine etc.)
* DESIGN DESIGN DESIGN details (stupid margins, stuff that you want to sell but looks like crap)
* social media
* collections (itineraries grouped by a certain theme)
* split on search for location or search for POI
* Ads based only on tourism
* NO Facebook signup (because fuck facebook)
* careful on route timing, check for inconsistencies and allow a margin of error
* transportation options are VERY IMPORTANT !!!!
* pre-built links in case of missing information (the site's job is to find and provide information)
* trip created locally, if they like it, they'll create an account
* include lunch in the itinerary, make eating profiles (on a budget, upscale etc.)
* itinerary overview
* pace of visiting !!!! IMPORTANT
* nightlife ????
* custom icons for venue types
* if a person typed in a location that they want to visit, why the hell are you suggesting something on the other side of the continent?
* general exploration page, where suggestions can be grouped
* pre-filter: WHERE? WHEN? WHAT?
